Not sure if you know this

But when we first met

I got so nervous I couldn't speak

In that very moment

I found the one and

My life had found its missing piece

So as long as I live I love you

Will have and hold you

You look so beautiful in white

And from now to my very last breath

This day I'll cherish

You look so beautiful in white

Tonight

What we have is timeless

My love is endless

And with this ring I

Say to the world

You're my every reason you're all that I believe in

With all my heart I mean every word

So as long as I live I love you

Will have and hold you

You look so beautiful in white

And from now to my very last breath

This day I'll cherish

You look so beautiful in white

Tonight

oooh oh

You look so beautiful in white

Na na na na

So beautiful in white

Tonight

And if our daughter is what our future holds

I hope she has your eyes

Finds love like you and I did

Yeah, if she falls in love ,I will let her go

I'll walk her down the aisle

She looks so beautiful in white

You look so beautiful in white

So as long as I live I love you

Will have and hold you

You look so beautiful in white

And from now to my very last breath

This day I'll cherish

You look so beautiful in white

Tonight

You look so beautiful in white

Tonight
